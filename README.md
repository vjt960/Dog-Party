# Dog-Party Project 

This ***Dog-Party*** project is my very first attempt to recreate a website UI based on a comprehensive layout. In this project, I use my elementary understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to structure, style, and then program a web page.

**Dog-Party Requirements:** 
#### Phase One:
- Build the site structure in HTML. 
- Style the site in CSS. 
- Create readme.md file to explain project and include screengrabs of the comp and my finished work.

#### Phase Two: 
- Make the ***Dog-Party*** site mobile-friendly. 
- Build functionality in JavaScript so that the user input changes the text "Some Dogs".
